This Calculator code used grid template for the structuring of the calculation buttons. Though it has simple calculation operations, does not include power button but it does include delimitation of international system and multiple operand screen to store the previous operand in order to take reference for the next calculation.

Here we also used UI and gradients for the background.

Here we used data- attributes for the button so that we can use it as an identifier for the different operations. Advantages of this data- attribute are that we can see where these attributes as part of the HTML are actually used i.e, in JS or in CSS.

Concepts Covered:
 
- How to use ES6 classes to organize code
- How to sync JavaScript code with a UI
- CSS Grid
- Flex-box
- The best way to cleanly handle user input
- How to debug complicated edge cases
